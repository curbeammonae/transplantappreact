# TransPLANT

TransPLANT is an application specifically designed for individuals looking to transform their lives by implementing more plant-based meals into their diet. Users can post and share recipes, making their transition easier than ever!


# How It's Made:

 Tech used: 
 TailwindCSS, JavaScript, React, Node, MongoDB, Firebase,


# Optimizations:

Currently working to provide "like" functionality so users can like their favorite recipes and refer to them at any time!



# Lessons Learned:
This was my first time using Redux to store client-side state, across the application for user log-in functionality.
